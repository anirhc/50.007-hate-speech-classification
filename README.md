# Hate-Speech-Classification
50.007 Machine Learning - Hate Speech Classification Project

Online hate speech is an important issue that breaks the cohesiveness of online social communities and even raises public safety concerns in our societies. Motivated by this rising issue, researchers have developed many traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to detect hate speech on online social platforms automatically.

Essentially, the detection of online hate speech can be formulated as a text classification task: "Given a social media post, classify if the post is hateful or non-hateful". In this project, you are to apply machine learning approaches to perform hate speech classification. Specifically, you will need to perform the following tasks.

**Task 1: Implement Logistics Regression (10 marks)**


**Task 2: Apply dimension reduction techniques (10 marks)**


**Task 3: Try other machine learning models and race to the top! (25 marks)**


**Task 4: Documenting your journey and thoughts (5 marks)**
